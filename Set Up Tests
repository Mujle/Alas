# Test set up

# Firefox config
Since mozila firefox does't allow self-signed signatures you will have 
to ajust the browser yourself:

1. start the backend with `mvnw spring-boot:run`

2. Open up firefox and write `about:preferences#privacy`
in the  address bar.

3. Go to `View Certificates` --> `Servers`  --> 
`Add Exception...` 

4. Write in `ttps://localhost:8080/` as an exception you want to make

5. Go `Get Certificate` --> `Confirm Security Exception`

# Start the test

Other than that all you need to do is:
 1. Go to terminal
 2. `cd` to root folder
 3. Start the tests with  `mvnw test`
 
 and that is it, gratz.
